 PROJECT DIRECTIONS:
 1) In Magic8Ball.swift, declare a constant playerName and assign it your (or any) name.
 2) Declare another constant playerQuestion and assign it a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù question for the Magic 8 Ball.
 3) Declare a constant randomNumber and assign it a randomly generated value between 1 and 9, printing it to verify the randomness.
 4) Declare a constant eightBall to hold a String value; leave it unassigned for now.
 5) Create a switch statement using randomNumber, with 9 cases to assign one of the 9 possible Magic 8 Ball answers to eightBall.
 6) Add a default statement to the switch, assigning the String "Error" to eightBall.
 7) Add a print statement to output the player's name followed by their question.
 8) Add a second print statement to output the Magic 8 Ball's answer.
 9) Run the program to see random answers; celebrate your awesome work! üéâ
 10) Set up an if/else statement to handle an empty playerName String, printing only the question if the name is empty.
 11) Convert the if/else statement from step 10 into a one-liner using the ternary conditional operator.
